Description:

When a new version of the Allen annotated atlas is released, do the following:

1. Download the annotated atlas file (nrrd format), and name it "annotation.nrrd"

2. Go to http://api.brain-map.org/api/v2/structure_graph_download/1.json

3. Copy and Paste all into notepad

4. Save as "annotation_label.json"   (NOT .txt format)

5. Run Step1-4.

6. Having done so, Go to the folder named "ROI_shp".

7. Delete all of the existing mat files within the folder.

8. Move the mat files newly created in Step 1-4 into "ROI_shp" folder.
 
   Step 6-8 is to replace the old version of annotated atlas with the updated one.

9. Now you are done with updating Allen annotated atlas.
